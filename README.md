# Motor-control-electrospinning-device
Implemented a motor control system with potentiometer for a Rotating Mandrel in a electrospinning device.

The ability of the metal mandrel to rotate will be controlled by a spinning motor. To control the speed of the motor, an analog input potentiometer will be implemented. To interface the potentiometer with the microcontrollers we require analog output conversion of the signal to digital so that the controller can read it. The 8051 microcontroller has a built-in ADC, so we do not need to use any external chip to implement this. We are going to use the ADC0 subsystem for the 8051 microcontroller. The voltage obtained from the potentiometer will then be connected to one of the first eight channels. This signal will be connected to a configuration register (AMX0CF) and will continue on single-ended mode. The gain is 1, determined by the programmable amplifier, so it will amplify the output signals. The output signal (digital now) will be sent to the motor drive to control the speed of the DC motor via Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). By keeping the signal digital, noise effects are minimized. This configuration with thus allow for direct control of the motorâ€™s speed, furthermore allowing for full manipulation of the mandrel system.
